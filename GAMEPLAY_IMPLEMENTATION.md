# Real-time Game Play Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the real-time game play feature for JepluSaaS, including WebSocket-based communication, teacher controls, presentation view, and student buzzer interface.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **GamePlay Component** (Teacher Control Interface)
   - Manages game session state
   - Controls question flow
   - Manages teams and scoring
   - Broadcasts events to other components

2. **PresentationView Component** (Projector Display)
   - Displays game board and questions
   - Shows team scores in real-time
   - Listens for all game events
   - Provides visual feedback for answers

3. **TeamBuzzer Component** (Student Interface)
   - Allows students to buzz in
   - Shows current question
   - Displays team status and score
   - Provides visual feedback when selected

### Real-time Communication
- **Technology**: Laravel Reverb (WebSocket server)
- **Broadcasting**: Laravel Echo with Pusher protocol
- **Channel**: `game-session.{session_id}` (public channel)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

**game_sessions table**:
- `id`: Primary key
- `game_id`: Foreign key to games
- `user_id`: Foreign key to users (teacher)
- `session_code`: Unique 8-character code
- `status`: waiting|active|paused|completed
- `current_question_id`: Foreign key to questions (nullable)
- `buzzed_team_id`: Foreign key to teams (nullable)
- `question_started_at`: Timestamp (nullable)
- `started_at`: Timestamp (nullable)
- `completed_at`: Timestamp (nullable)

**teams table**:
- `id`: Primary key
- `game_session_id`: Foreign key to game_sessions
- `name`: Team name
- `color`: Hex color code
- `score`: Integer (default 0)
- `buzzer_code`: Unique 6-character code

**buzzer_events table**:
- `id`: Primary key
- `game_session_id`: Foreign key to game_sessions
- `team_id`: Foreign key to teams
- `question_id`: Foreign key to questions
- `buzzed_at`: Timestamp
- `response_time_ms`: Integer

### Security Considerations

1. **Session Codes**: Auto-generated, unique, uppercase
2. **Buzzer Codes**: Auto-generated, unique per team
3. **Authorization**: Teacher must own the game to control session
4. **Public Access**: Presentation and team views are public (by design)
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limits to buzz endpoint

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Eager Loading**: Relationships are eager loaded to minimize queries
2. **Broadcasting**: Events broadcast only to specific session channel
3. **Auto-refresh**: Components auto-refresh every 5 seconds as fallback
4. **Efficient Updates**: Only changed data is broadcast

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues

**Problem**: Events not broadcasting
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure Reverb server is running: `php artisan reverb:start`
2. Check `.env` configuration matches
3. Verify `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb`
4. Check browser console for connection errors

**Problem**: "Connection refused" error
**Solution**:
1. Verify Reverb port (8080) is not in use
2. Check firewall settings
3. Ensure `REVERB_HOST` matches your setup

### Event Not Received

**Problem**: Component not updating
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Echo is properly initialized
3. Check event name matches exactly
4. Ensure session ID is correct in channel name

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow updates or lag
**Solution**:
1. Check network latency
2. Reduce auto-refresh interval if needed
3. Optimize database queries
4. Consider Redis for scaling
