## Common Issues

### WebSocket Not Connecting

2. Verify `.env` has correct Reverb settings
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try refreshing the page

### Buzzer Not Working
**Symptom**: Clicking buzz button does nothing
**Solution**:
1. Ensure buzzers are enabled in teacher interface
2. Check that question is revealed
3. Verify team hasn't already buzzed
4. Check browser console for errors

### Scores Not Updating
**Symptom**: Points awarded but scores don't change
**Solution**:
1. Check WebSocket connection
2. Verify event is being broadcast (check Reverb debug output)
3. Refresh the page
4. Check database to see if score was saved

## Advanced Testing

### Test with Multiple Devices
1. Use actual mobile phones/tablets
2. Connect to same network
3. Use computer's IP address instead of localhost
4. Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000/play/team`

### Test Network Issues
1. Throttle network in browser DevTools
2. Disconnect and reconnect WiFi
3. Verify auto-refresh works as fallback

### Test Edge Cases
1. Buzz in at exact same time (multiple devices)
2. Enable/disable buzzers rapidly
3. Award points to wrong team (then correct it)
4. Close question without revealing answer
5. End game with questions remaining

## Performance Testing

### Monitor Reverb Server
Watch the debug output for:
- Connection events
- Message broadcasts
- Any errors or warnings

### Check Browser Performance
Open DevTools and monitor:
- Network tab for WebSocket connection
- Console for any errors
- Performance tab for lag

### Database Queries
Check Laravel logs for:
- Number of queries per action
- Slow queries
- N+1 query issues
